### Implementation Module (21 functions documented)
3. **src/implementation/barrier_policy.rs** (2 functions)
   - `pub unsafe fn submit()` - Documents command buffer state requirements

   - `pub unsafe fn load_device_functions()` - Documents device handle requirements

5. **src/implementation/persistent_descriptors.rs** (5 functions)
   - `pub unsafe fn create_persistent_layout()` - Documents descriptor layout lifecycle
   - `pub unsafe fn get_persistent_pool()` - Documents pool limits and thread safety
   - `pub unsafe fn get_persistent_descriptor_set()` - Documents buffer validity requirements
   - `pub unsafe fn create_compute_pipeline_layout()` - Documents push constant limits

   - `unsafe fn free()` (MemoryPool method) - Documents deallocation requirements
   - `pub unsafe fn initialize_pools()` - Documents device initialization requirements
   - `pub unsafe fn allocate_from_pool()` - Documents pool initialization requirements
   - `pub unsafe fn free_allocation()` - Documents resource cleanup ordering
   - `pub unsafe fn allocate_buffer_memory()` - Documents buffer binding requirements

7. **src/implementation/timeline_batching.rs** (5 functions)
   - `pub unsafe fn create_timeline_semaphore()` - Documents Vulkan 1.2 requirements
   - `pub unsafe fn get_queue_timeline()` - Documents queue-device relationship
   - `pub unsafe fn submit_batch()` - Documents command buffer state requirements
   - `pub unsafe fn wait_timeline()` - Documents blocking behavior
   - `pub unsafe fn submit()` (BatchBuilder method) - Documents batch submission safety

## Key Safety Themes Documented

1. **Handle Validity**: All functions document requirements for valid Vulkan handles
2. **Lifetime Management**: Clear documentation of resource ownership and cleanup
3. **Thread Safety**: Documents which functions rely on mutexes for synchronization
4. **Undefined Behavior**: Explicit warnings about operations that cause UB
5. **Function Pointer Safety**: Documents transmutation and signature requirements
6. **Memory Safety**: Documents allocation, mapping, and deallocation requirements

## Verification

All unsafe functions now include a `# Safety` section that explains:
- Preconditions that must be met
- Invariants that must be maintained
- Potential undefined behavior if misused
- Thread safety considerations
- Resource lifetime requirements

## Next Steps

With safety documentation complete, the next items in EPIC2 are:
1. Fix compilation errors in binary examples (Milestone 1.3)
2. Add CI/CD pipeline (Milestone 2.1)
3. Expand test coverage (Milestone 2.2)
